# VSC Configurations

## settings.json

Contains my personal visual studio code settings file. Some important things to change for your particular setup:

- colorTheme: I like to work black on white, change to whatever makes you more comfortable
- phpcs.executablePath: full path to your phpcs.phar file
- phpcs.standard: full path to your coreBOS standard recomendations folder (cbSR)
- renderWhitespace: this one is **MANDATORY** you need to see the spaces and tabs to make it easier for you to apply the coreBOS coding format
- rulers: same as renderWhitespace
- files.associations: useful for those few strange extension we have
- eslint: review paths

The extensions I have installed are:

- Auto Close Tag
- Auto Rename Tag
- Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
- Docker
- Eclipse Keymap (I have spent many years working with eclipse)
- ESLint
- Go
- GraphQL
- HTML CSS Support
- IntelliSense for CSS class names
- lit-html
- PHP Debug and Extension Pack
- phpcs
- Project Manager
- Smarty
- XML Format and Tools
- mardownlint
